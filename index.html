Wow… what a beautiful morning that was, definitely the best one in my life. That morning I expressed my feelings to you, a bit hesitant, a bit unsure whether to say over the phone or not, but I just couldn’t stop myself, I had so much feelings in my heart that I just couldn’t. that night was probably the most difficult one for me because I was controlling my emotions, my feelings, my words, and thus was only dreaming and thinking about saying I love you, to you. And then when I said it to you, the feeling I got was one of the best feelings my chest had ever felt. Saying ‘I love you’ to the right person takes no more than a couple of seconds, but the feeling it leaves in your heart lasts a whole eternity and makes you so addicted that you want to hear it again and again. And this feeling, I want to feel it for the rest of my life and forever meri jaan. I want to love you and I want to be loved by you for the rest of eternity. <br>
Its only been a couple of months that we’ve known each other for, and it’s only been a month that we’ve been each other’s, but it feels like we have been together forever meri jaan, and that is what happens when two souls that are meant for each other, meet. Just saying that we love each other is an underestimation of our relationship. Our relationship is like no other, our bonding is like no one else’s, our love is the purest ever, our understanding is the greatest ever, our feelings are the most honest ever, our respect is the most completed, our attachment is the strongest ever, our happiness is the most unstoppable ever, our laughter is the loudest ever, our smiles are the realest ever, and connection is the finest ever, basically, we are matchless, and that’s something that makes me feel the luckiest and happiest man ever. <br>
Meri jaan, we’ve seen rain and sun, cloud and clear skies, night and day. We have also seen happy mornings and miserable nights, lonely hours and minutes that have ran by too fast. One month in and I can’t wait for what may happen in front of us. Meri jaan, no obstacle is too big, no mountain too high, no problem is too complex, no situation is too complicated. Meri jaan, we’ll have stormy seas and motionless lakes, thunders and floods, but none of them will be stronger that our love, and month after month, we’ll make it through. So meri jaan, never you have to ever in our relationship to worry about anything, our love is so beautiful, pure and strong that no one can ever apart us from each other, we know that we are each other’s soul mates, and our souls are meant for each other, they are made for each other, therefore we don’t have to worry about anything else, we believe in our God, we believe in our love, and we know that no one can take us away from each other. <br>
Meri jaan, I love you, and I love you more than anything else meri jaan. I am yours forever, and you are mine forever, and we are each other’s. I will forever be yours, and you will forever be mine, and we will forever be each other’s, beside each other, with each other. </p>
